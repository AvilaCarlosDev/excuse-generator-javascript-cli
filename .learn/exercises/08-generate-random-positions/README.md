# `08` Generate Random Positions

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Generate a random number that can be used to access a value from each of the arrays (`who`, `what`, and `when`) and store each of these values in a different variable.

## 💡 Hint:

+ Remember the random number used as the position to access a value from the array should be between 0 and the length of the array (Each of the arrays have different lengths).
