# `00` Welcome

Let's create a CLI that generate excuses with Javascript.

For this project we are using arrays to get different values randomly. 

Let's remind how we can access to array values. Array values can be accessed by using the number of the position, the position number will start from 0, therefore if we want to access to the second element of the array we use position 1.

Here is an example of how to access array values:

```js
let animals = ["horse", "dog", "cat"];
console.log(animals[1]); // This will print "dog".
```

> Notice that we are using the number `1` between the square brackets `[]` to access the second position ("dog") of this array `animals`.

Now that we know how to access array values, let's explain why we chose arrays to generate a random excuse. In Javascript if you want to generate random values, you have to start by generating random numbers. We can access the values of an array using this random number as the position of the element that will be accessed from the array, and that's how we are going to solve this challenge.

In this project, you'll learn about generating random numbers, accessing array values, concatenating strings, and improving your programming logic with a cool and fun real-life approach.

We'll guide you step-by-step until you complete the assignment. Teaching you all these new concepts with automated tests that will tell you if you are going on the right path.

I hope you enjoy the project and learn new concepts here!
